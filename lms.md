LMS - Logitech Media Server
LMS is a web based system for managing the playing of your music collection.  It lets you build and play playlists based on a variety of criteria and select one or more players, which can play either individually or synchronised.
LMS has it's own user interface, but an additional one, known as the Material Skin is available as an add-in.
